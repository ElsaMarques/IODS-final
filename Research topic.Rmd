# - Research topic and hypothesis 

 > For this exercise I am using the hobbies dataset that can be found in the FactoMineR libray. I will try to evaluate how different are the hobbies undertaken by gender, age, marital status and by the person main professions. Assuming that more demanding professions will leave less space for hobbies or for more less time consuming hobbies. Also there is some hobbies that are stereotypically associated with one or the other gender of the enquired people.
