# - Conclusions and discussion 

- In summary, let's have a look on my initial hypothesis and results: 
    - Will more demanding professions leave less space for hobbies or people will chose less time consuming hobbies? 
    - Is there some hobbies that are stereotypically associated with one or the other gender of the enquired people? 
    - Is age related with the amount and type of hobbies that inquired undertake?

        - Our analysis indicated that the amount of hobbies (take in account the results from both gender) goes up in the 35 - 45 age groups, after that the amount of hobbies will slighly decrease in the females group and more steadly stay up in the males groups.
